# Ancient sedimentary DNA analysis

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

**On this github** You will find the scripts used to analyse the sedimentary DNA sequences from the paper: *New coastal records in northern Brittany (Plouescat, NW France): Sedimentological, palynological and paleogenomic data over the last 7.3 ka BP*  

The pipeline is split into two parts:
- **METAGE_1_pipeline_v4.sh**
- **METAGE_1_pipeline_v4.sh**

Between the two, we have a biocuration step of the reads on **Geneious**(*version 2023.1.2, https://www.geneious.com*).
Tools and versions are found in the scripts.
Full description of the pipeline can be found in the paper.
